place: Salt Lake City, UT
abstract: "Active learning, constructivism, socio-constructivism, critical pedagogy, critical constructivism - these learning theories are more than just buzzwords. Theyâ€™re important instructional strategies that can play central roles in shaping and motivating learners, but are often misinterpreted, misunderstood, and misapplied. Rather than viewing theory and practice as discrete, mutually exclusive approaches to our roles as educators, this presentation will focus on elevating our teaching through praxis: the negotiation of theory into practice with a reflective component. Through a series of exercises and interactions facilitated by four experienced instruction librarians, this presentation will help you understand what these pedagogical practices mean and how (and why) you should be using them in your instruction."
