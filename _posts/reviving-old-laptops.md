My family gives me their discarded technologies. Maybe it is because they somehow sense my fondness for such things, or because I unknowingly transmit a deep belief that the life and utility of (at times) beautifully designed objects should be longer. Maybe it is because I used to work in a sort of natural history museum for discarded formats and standards, and that a small part of our work was to  transcode and update any recently found bits of sound or video on tape, or laserdisc, or betamax into other, newer standards.
