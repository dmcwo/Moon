People give me their discarded technologies. Maybe it is because they somehow sense my fondness for such things, or because I unknowingly transmit a deep belief that the life and utility of (at times) beautifully designed objects is longer than we often suspect. Maybe it is because I used to work in a sort of natural history museum for discarded formats and standards, and that a small part of our work was to stand ready to transcode and update some recently found bit of sound or video on tape, or laserdisc, or betamax into something contemporary or current.
