In libraries, we're in the early stages of a very important effort to re-think assessment. [ACRL's Value report](http://www.acrl.ala.org/value/), the impressive and growing number of [Assessment in Action](http://www.ala.org/acrl/AiA) projects, and an increased interest in [connections between libraries and SOTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19tSlZXLwrm0cl2kfmJMBVRC41MnZiVbvQVe3z8gm4gA/edit) all offer positive steps forward and practical approaches to assessment and improved communication of the essential value of library staff, services, and collections. In general, these are very good things.

At the same time, however, we're seeing more and more unrest and discomfort among many library staff about how assessment is interpreted, discussed, and implemented in libraries. It may be time already to re-think our approach to assessment ... again.

One challenge in our current practice, as I see it, is that the question "how will you assess that?" has become almost ritualistic, particularly among those who, for whatever reason, seem to be interested in finding a way to sink a project or idea. At times, the question is asked from genuine, well-meaning, intellectual curiousity; but, in my experience at least, that doesn't seem to be the norm. The "assessment question" inevitably has an edge to it, an underlying purpose, a skeptical superiority that can be unnerving at conferences, and even more unsettling in meetings and brainstorming sessions.

I first wrote about this [healthy discontent](), in a reflection on #liw16[fn-liw16]. More recently, I've seen the thread continue at both #c4lib17[fn-c4lib17], and #lilac17[fn-lilac17]. In this post, I'm trying to bring together a few related strands from these three conferences, and turn them into a few reflective questions we can ask about  .... assessment.

### What's motivating our assessment strategy?

I've been thinking lately that there might be other ways to ask and answer these questions, that (I hope) place less of a burden on teams trying to make things and explore new approaches.


When we think continually about success, I think we may also be continually thinking about failure; and I don't think that is a particularly good thing to do. The false dichotomy of a success/failure mindset asks us to always classify our work as one or the other. This mindset also seems, for many, to imply the need to reduce the definition of "success" to some sort of easily quantifiable measurement: workshop attendees, youtube views, circulation records, .... If we need to be able to continually classify our work as *either* a success or a failure, it is convenient and efficient to have a yardstick handy.

But, I'm skeptical of the idea that S.M.A.R.T goals necessarily make us smarter. Quite the contrary, a success/failure mindset rarely places a focus on personal or organizational learning. And given the complexities of measuring student learning, even that is often set aside in favor of easier to quantify metrics.

I like numbers, to be sure. Charts and graphs, too.



If a workshop series that has had low levels of attendance suddenly becomes popular, is it suddenly successful? Was it a failure just a moment ago, even if the work and effort put in when few students attended made its eventual "success" possible? If only a few students show up the next time it is offered, is it a failure again?


Strategy, momentum, direction

What are your goals for the project?

What do you hope to learn?

Where are we going? What are we learning?

What do we need to learn?

How will this project foster student success? What will we learn about the student experience?

How will we find out the things we need to know to improve?

in our efforts to anticipate the inevitibility of having to answer this question, creative projects sometimes falter.

I worry sometimes that a constant focus on success (and quantitative evaluation) leads to not quite enough failure.

I've been thinking lately that we might be spending too much time thinking about success. Asking "how will you measure and quantify your success?" has become almost ritualistic. and in our efforts to anticipate the inevitibility of having to answer this question, creative projects sometimes falter.
