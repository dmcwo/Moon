## Hi there! I'm [Doug](http://dmcwo.com)

Mostly a place to jot things down, this notebook is a rather experimental place for me to try to keep track of and hopefully reflect on the things Iâ€™m doing and creating. I'm hoping to write here about libraries, knowledge building communities, instructional design, the environmental factors that influence creativity and innovation, and the diverse practices of researchers and writers.

Significant inspiration for this online notebook came from the discovery of several [open research notebooks](https://www.zotero.org/groups/543491/items/tag/notebook).

## technical ty's:

This site is created with [jekyll](jekyllrb.com), and benefits from an only very slightly modified version of the <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a> theme.

The very classy "Notebook icon" on the homepage is by [Bruno Castro](http://thenounproject.com/brunocast/#) from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).
