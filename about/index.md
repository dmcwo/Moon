## Hi there! I'm [Doug](http://dmcwo.com)

This notebook is mostly a place for me to jot things down, experiment with writing online, and do my best to keep track of (and hopefully reflect on) the things Iâ€™m doing and creating. I suspect most of the writing here will have something to do with libraries, knowledge building communities, instructional design, the environmental factors that influence innovation and creativity, and the diverse practices of researchers and writers.

Significant inspiration for this site came from the discovery of several [open research notebooks](https://www.zotero.org/groups/543491/items/tag/notebook).

## technical ty's:

This site benefits from an only very slightly modified version of <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a>, a minimal, one column jekyll theme. You can see a [live version of the Moon theme](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon) hosted on GitHub. To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://taylantatli.me/Moon/moon-theme/) for more information.

The very classy "Notebook icon" on the homepage is by [Bruno Castro](https://thenounproject.com/brunocast/#) from the Noun Project
