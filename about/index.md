## Hi there! I'm [Doug](http://dmcwo.com)

This notebook is an experimental and evolving place for me to take notes on the things Iâ€™m doing and creating. I'm hoping to write here about learning, libraries, knowledge building communities, instructional design, the creative process, and the diverse practices of researchers and writers.

Significant inspiration for this online notebook came from the discovery of several [open research notebooks](https://www.zotero.org/groups/543491/items/tag/notebook).

## technical ty's:

This site is created with [jekyll](jekyllrb.com), and benefits from an only very slightly modified version of the <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a> theme.

The very classy "Notebook icon" on the homepage is by [Bruno Castro](http://thenounproject.com/brunocast/#) from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).
