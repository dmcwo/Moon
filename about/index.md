## Hi there! I'm [Doug Worsham](http://twitter.com/dmcwo)

This site is an experimental online notebook for jotting down ideas, tinkering with web design, and sharing notes and handouts from [conference presentations]({{site.url}}/presentations). I try to write here about learning, libraries, knowledge building communities, instructional design, the creative process, and the diverse practices of researchers and writers.

## a few ty's:

* Inspiration for this online notebook came from the discovery of several [open research notebooks](https://www.zotero.org/groups/543491/items/tag/notebook).
* This site is created with [jekyll](jekyllrb.com), and benefits from an only very slightly modified version of the <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a> theme.
* The very classy "Notebook icon" on the homepage is by [Bruno Castro](http://thenounproject.com/brunocast/#) from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).
