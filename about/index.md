## ty:

This site benefits from an only very slightly modified version of <a href="http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon"><b>Moon</b></a>, a minimal, one column jekyll theme. You can see a [live version of the Moon theme](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon) hosted on GitHub. To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://taylantatli.me/Moon/moon-theme/) for more information.

The very classy "Notebook icon" on the homepage is by [Bruno Castro](https://thenounproject.com/brunocast/#) from the Noun Project
